My name is Amelia Carlson, I’m an illustration student at the Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, NY. I’ve been drawing since before middle school and have loved animals and wildlife for even longer. My father has always taught me the value and beauty of the natural world, leaving me with a curiosity and fascination for all the creatures we share this world with. I struggled with deciding whether to pursue art or biology as a career for a long time before attending college, and had never really considered combining the two until taking a class with Alan Singer, a wildlife illustrator and professor in RIT’s illustration program. He believed that I could have a future in this field, so I’m trying hard to prove him right.

Since starting down this path I have done a lot of research on successful wildlife and scientific illustrators and continued education programs hoping to hone my skill set as much as possible. I started this blog to record some of what I found during said research, as well as keep track of my own progress. I enjoy going to wildlife reserves to sketch, photograph, or even to simply observe and appreciate my surroundings; so I also will be using this blog as an opportunity to record and remember any important experiences in field work and travel opportunities.
