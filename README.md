### Credits

[Artem Sheludko](https://github.com/artemsheludko) created Galada, a free (MIT) Jekyll theme with incredible portability, design, and beauty. [Chris Partridge](https://github.com/tweedge) then performed a few hacky hacks to streamline it and deprecate some old functionality. In addition, this site makes use of the following resources, either as embedded content or via hyperlink:

*   [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) (Nunito, Sans Serif).
*   [Ionicons Icons](https://ionicons.com/)

### Posts

To create a new post, you can create a new markdown file inside the \_posts directory by following the [recommended file structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#creating-post-files).

      ---
      layout: post
      title: Premiere on Broadway
      date: 2018-08-23 16:04:00 +0300
      image: 03.jpg
      tags: [Rest]
      ---
          

You can set the tags and the post image.

Add post images to **/img/** directory.

For tags, try to not add space between two words, for example, `Ruby on Rails`, could be something like (`ruby-on-rails`, `Ruby_on_Rails`, or `Ruby-on-Rails`).
